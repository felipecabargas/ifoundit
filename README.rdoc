This repo contains all the source code for IFOUNDIT.

What is IFOUNDIT?

It's a rails web application that helps people to find whatever them lost through the community. It's like a Waze but for people searching for their dissapeared loved ones.

==== The app is currently available at http://ifoundit.herokuapp.com
